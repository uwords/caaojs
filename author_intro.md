##Prerequisites

Please be sure to have your login data for OJS available - it was sent by you via E-Mail.

If you didn't receive such an E-Mail, please read How to get an account for OJS.

 

After login you see your "User Home" with a list of all roles you have in OJS.

Right beneath "Author" you click on the link [New Submission] to go to the five step submission procedure.

 
 
##Step 1. Starting the submission

 

Here you see a checklist. You can only proceed to the next step, if you have checked all items.

You can add a comment to the editors.

 

 
Step 2. Uploading the Submission

 

Here you can upload your paper (called "submission" in OJS terminology).

 

 
Step 3. Entering the Submission's Metadata

 

The fields are already prefilled with your author data.

If your paper has further authors, please add them by pressing the "Add author" button - the further authors don't need to have OJS accounts, if you are the primary author.

 

Please enter also the references from your paper.

 

 
Step 4. Uploading Supplementary Files

 

This is an optional step - you can simply go to the next step by pressing the "Save and continue" button..

 

 
Step 5. Confirming the submission

 

 If you have clicked on "Finish submission", the editors get an automatic E-mail with your submitted paper and you will be later informed by OJS via E-Mail as soon as the review for your paper has been made.
